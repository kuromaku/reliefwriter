reliefwriter
============

A simple text editor that allows the user to write using only three letters on any keyboard. This may be helpful in the case wrist movements cause pain.

The default keys in use are 'a' 's' 'd'. To type in any ascii-character first select the "TypingArea" and just start typing. To see what sequence you
need to type in order to get a particular character select "Show Codes" from the "Help" menu. To make editing text easier you can use 'q' to delete the previous character and 'w' to end the line. If you select a particular position in the DisplayArea using the mouse, typing in 'z' will switch to the "TypingArea".
